# Contributing to Nectar

Thank you for considering contributing to Nectar. There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code. The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Nectar.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [icharania04@gmail.com](mailto:icharania04@gmail.com).

## Reporting Bugs

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Create an issue to explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.

## Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Create an issue and provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of Nectar which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.

## Pull Requests

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Explain the type of contribution you are making such as a bug fix, performance improvement, documentation update, or a functionality change. 
2. Describe the design of your change.
3. If applicable, explain what other alternate designs were considered and why the proposed version was selected.
4. If applicable, explain the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change.
5. If applicable, explain the process you followed to verify that your change has the desired effects. How did you verify that all new functionality works as expected? How did you verify that all changed functionality works as expected? How did you verify that the change has not introduced any regressions? Describe the actions you performed and describe the results you observed.
6. If this change is user-facing or notable enough to be included in release notes, please describe the changes in a single line that explains this improvement in terms that a user can understand and mark this as **Release Notes**.
7. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing. If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
